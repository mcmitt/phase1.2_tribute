            <h4>A timeline of Herta's invention:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-1949:</strong> Herta Heuwer, a cook and saleswoman, worked at KaDeWe,
                    the largest department store in Charlottenburg, and later lived in the British
                    sector of Berlin.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1949:</strong> Heuwer, while running her snack bar, experimented with a 
                    sauce made from tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, curry powder and other spices,
                    which she then poured over boiled, fried, or grilled pork sausage.

                </li>
                <li><strong>September, 1949:</strong> Heuwer started selling her "Spezial Curry Bratwurst" 
                    from her stall in Charlottenburg. This is when this dish earned the appelation of Currywurst.</li>
                <li><strong>January, 1951:</strong> Heuwer registered a trademark for her sauce under the name "Chillup".</li>
                <li><strong>Mid-1950s:</strong> "Currywurst" became popular, especially with the local workforce.</li>
                <li><strong>1960:</strong> Konnopke's Imbiss (Fast Food Stand) in Berlin became the first 
                    Imbiss to sell currywurst in East-Berlin.</li>
                <li><strong>1974:</strong> Heuwer's small restaurant closed.</li>
                <li><strong>June 2003:</strong> The day before what would have been her 90th birthday, 
                    a commemorative plaque was unveiled by Charlottenburg Mayor Monika Thiemen 
                    at the site where Herta Heuwer invented the currywurst.</li>
                <li><strong>June 2013:</strong> Google celebrated Heuwer's centenary of her birthday with a 
                    Google Doodle.</li>
                <li><strong>January 2019:</strong> Berlin State Mint minted a commemorative medal to mark the 
                    70th anniversary of the invention of the Currywurst, on which she is depicted 
                    together with two currywursts.
