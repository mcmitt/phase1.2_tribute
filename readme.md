## Requirements:
1. You are required to build a web page that is functionally similar to this page:

1. You are not expected to copy the page exactly. You should choose your own subject, images, content, and styles.
1. For this part of the project, you are not required to use Bootstrap. The only requirements are to use HTML and CSS to create a responsive Tribute page.
1. You should set this project up in Visual Studio Code. You can use the supplied lab machines or your own computer if you have a development environment.
1. Some resources for images:
    - Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/
    - Creative Commons Search: https://search.creativecommons.org/
1. For information about your subject, you can use Wikipedia, Google, or any other web resources.
The goal is not to wite a report but to demonstrate your skill with HTML and CSS.
